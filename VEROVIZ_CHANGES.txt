Fixed bug in validation for getConvexHull (valGetConvexHull()).

Added validation for lists of lat/lon coordinates (_valLatLonList()).  Now checks for existence of list of lists.

Added validation for all Utility functions.  Now checks for existence of required inputs.

cesium colors no longer require 'Cesium.Color' prefix.

createLeaflet() -- Should be OK if neither nodes, arcs, nor boundingRegion are specified.  

Added ORS-local as a valid dataProvider


FIXME -- Sketch:
	NODES
	DONE elevMeters
	DONE popupText
	DONE don't use 'Cesium.Color'
	DONE Create list of dictionaries instead.  (one dict per node)
	
	ARCS
	DONE ???


DONE -- createLeaflet()
	- popupText is an OVERRIDE for nodes only.
	- Probably should just remove this option.  What functions are impacted?
	
	createLeaflet(popupText)
		valCreateLeaflet(popupText)
		
		_createLeafletNodes	
	
	
FIXME -- Install ORS
Install new map data

FUTURE -- Choropleths
CM:  draw elevation profile?
CM:  import from GTFS?



ORS-local
	Snap to road
	isochrones (although total_pop is missing)
	shapepoints (no wheelchair)
	matrix (no wheelchair)
	

	geocode --> geocode/search / GET
		https://ask.openrouteservice.org/t/geocoder-on-github/1000
		WON'T BE SUPPORTED -- USE OTHER PROVIDER
			
	reverse --> geocode/reverse / GET
		WON'T BE SUPPORTED -- USE OTHER PROVIDER

	elevation --> elevation / POST
		https://github.com/GIScience/openelevationservice
		WON'T BE SUPPORTED -- USE OTHER PROVIDER
	
	
	Correct, we run Vroom for optimization, 
	Pelias for geocoding, 
	openpoiservice for POIs and 
	openelevationservice for elevation queries. 
	Those are all separate from the openrouteservice repository.

	


.rst files
	Update nodes/arcs/assignments to indicate new column (popupText)
	
	Update assignments to indicate we have a new column (ganttColor)
	Update comparison page (arcs vs assignments)

	Update data providers
		FIXME -- Add ORS-local
		
		
	WHAT ELSE???

FIXME
	- Re-run Cesium demo (and zip into veroviz_cesium_viewer.zip)
	- Include page of models



Website
	- Links to Jupyter notebooks
	
	- Upload new Cesium plugin
	
	WHAT ELSE???
	
	
	
	

Dataframe Changes:
	Assignments
		Added `ganttColor` column.  Defaults to 'darkgray'.  Used to specify colors in `createGantt()` function.

		Added popupText column.  Defaults to None.
		
		Added `startElevMeters` and `endElevMeters` columns.  Default to None
				
	Nodes:
		Added options to draw circle nodes
		Added popupText column.  Defaults to None.

		Added `elevMeters` column.  Defaults to None

	Arcs:		
		Added popupText column.  Defaults to None.

		??? Added `startElevMeters` and `endElevMeters` columns.  Default to None
		

******
Added 'wheelchair' and 'shortest' routeType options for ORS-online
	(they had this data, we just weren't configured to capture it)
	
	



New Utility Functions:
	isochrones()
	createGantt()
	getElevation()
	closestPointLoc2Path()
	closestNode2Loc()
	lengthFromNodeSeq()
	calcArea()
	getWeather()

	LP:  zipcode function(s)?
	
	

New Leaflet Functions:
	addLeafletIcon()
	addLeafletIsochrones()
	addLeafletWeather()
