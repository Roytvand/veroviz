# Examples

The following Jupyter notebooks are available, with example code:
- [function_examples.ipynb](function_examples.ipynb) -- Examples for every veroviz function. 
    - These examples match those provided in each function's "docstring".  Within a Jupyter notebook, you may use the `?` magic command to view a function's complete documentation.  For example:
        ```
        import veroviz as vrv
        # See the documentation for the `generateNodes()` function:
        vrv.generateNodes?
        ```
    - You may download this notebook from [https://veroviz.org/downloads/function_examples.ipynb.zip](https://veroviz.org/downloads/function_examples.ipynb.zip)
